Tracifier benchs:
http://bench.casadev.cs.au.dk/master/

if you want to play with tracifier or experiment with drivers you can download the tracified library by browsing to the library of your interest http://bench.casadev.cs.au.dk/master/ (column TAJS(on tracified) and clicking download.
The file program.generated.html is a minimal html file that import the tracified library.

You also need our special TAJS, which you can find here http://casadev.cs.au.dk/JSRACES/TAJS-meta
You have to ensure to also checkout the submodules (jalangilogger and tajs itself).
To run TAJS on the generated program simply issue the following command

./tajs_meta -line-analysis2 -no-soundness tajs <<program.generated location>>


Future work:
    - Symbolic execution could be used to get the under-approximation to be less of an under-approximation (speculation: It can help a lot to get methods, that otherwise crash, to return normally).

If static analysis:
    // Static analysis can actually give spurious warnings, with un-reachable unions.
    // Find 5 small node-applications, that has TypeScript declarations, as analysis-targets.
