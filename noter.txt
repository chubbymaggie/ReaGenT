TODO:
TODO: - Få testet TypeScript 2.3 features.
TODO: - Få ts-spec-reader til at exporterer ambient types.
TODO: - Support Symbol (see IterableIterator)
TODO: - Remove the dependency to explicitly declare the module name.
TODO: - Try to look at the exceptions that happen during runtime. See if they can be used for anything.

TODO: For TAJSCheck conversion:
- Remove all fixing of non-determinism. (Have two separate prelude.js/dumb.js, instead of having "if tajs...").

Future work:
    - Symbolic execution could be used to get the under-approximation to be less of an under-approximation (speculation: It can help a lot to get methods, that otherwise crash, to return normally).

If static analysis:
    // Static analysis can actually give spurious warnings, with un-reachable unions.
    // Find 5 small node-applications, that has TypeScript declarations, as analysis-targets.
